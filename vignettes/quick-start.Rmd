The following will show you how to get up and running with the ui editor from scratch. 

If you prefer video format, here's an [in-depth walkthrough of using the ui editor to create and edit a new app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYPnLiudtGU).


## Pre-reqs

- `shinyuieditor` package installed. See the [installing section](../index.html#installing)
- Shiny app with ui built using [`gridlayout::gridpage()`](https://rstudio.github.io/gridlayout/) or `shiny::navbarPage()` (more layout functions coming soon.) 



## Running

### New app

If you set the argument `app_loc` to a location that does not yet exist, the will start in a template-chooser interface. Here you can select a complete app template which will then be written to your `app_loc` and then be edited as an existing app would be. 

```r
shinyuieditor::launch_editor(app_loc = "new-app/")
```

_There are just a few templates available currently but more are always being added._

### Existing app

Assuming there's an existing app (either `app.R` or `ui.R` and `server.R`) in the folder `existing-app/` relative to your current working directly (`getwd()`), then you start the ui-editor on that app by running the following code and pasting the returned link into your web-browser.

```r
shinyuieditor::launch_editor(app_loc = "existing-app/")
#> Live editor running at http://localhost:44509/app
```

## Editing your app

Once you're in the editor, any changes you make will automatically be written to your app's UI and the changes can be seen in real-time with the "App Preview" window.

For more info on how to perform various tasks with the editor, see `vignette("how-to")`. 

## Saving/Closing editor

When you're done, simply close the browser window (or press {control/command}-c in the console) to stop the editor preview process in R. Since all changes are eagerly applied there's no need to save.
