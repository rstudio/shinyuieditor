A visual tool for building the UI portion of a Shiny application that generates clean and human-readable code.

The goal of the Shiny Ui Editor is to allow people to build the broad-level UI for their Shiny app without writing code. The editor is intended for those who may not be comfortable with the HTML-style code of Shiny's UI functions or who simply don't want to fiddle with sizes to get things laid out correctly.
